# VandEvents
A campus event discovery and publicization platform designed for Vanderbilt University

Created by Jacqueline Bruce, Dylan Hanson, Rachel Lee, Cheyenne Deibert, Sue Yixin Wang, and Peter Yuxin Wu

Fall 2022

## Conceptual System Description:

Our app will connect students looking for events with organization leaders who wish to promote and receive feedback on their events. We need this system because the current options for finding events are unintuitive, inflexible, and unfriendly. Students want to find events they will enjoy and student organization leaders want students to attend their events and have fun. We want a centralized system where you can find events across all of the student organizations on campus with up to date information.

Functionalities:

* For You Page: Quickly see events happenning this week, today, and with friends
* Calendar: Find events by date
* Search: Search for and discover organizations and events
* Event Details: The date, time, a detailed description of the event, friends attending, location, and an option to RSVP
* Profile: Quickly see your RSVPs and manage your organizations
* Manage Organizations: if you are an admin (org leader), you can edit the org's profile, create a new event, and edit upcoming events.
